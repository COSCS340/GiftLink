				<p>
					This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 
					'Personally Identifiable Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy 
					law and information security, is information that can be used on its own or with other information 
					to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify an individual in context. Please 
					read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect, use, protect or 
					otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.

				<br><br>
					<b>California Online Privacy Protection Act</b>
				<br><br>
					CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The 
					law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that 
					operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on 
					its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. 
				<br><br>
					See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
				<br><br>

					we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website. Our 
					Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above.

				<br><br>
					<b>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</b>
				<br><br>
					When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, 
					the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, 
					United States' consumer protection agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites 
					and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety online.
				<br><br>
					We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old. Do we let third-parties, including ad 
					networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13
				<br><br>
					<b>Fair Information Practices</b>
				<br><br>
					The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts 
					they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding the 
					Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various privacy 
					laws that protect personal information.
				<br><br>
					In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach 
					occur: We will notify you via email • Within 1 business day
				<br><br>
					We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable 
					rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that individuals have 
					enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or 
					prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
				<br><br>
					<b>CAN SPAM Act</b>
				<br><br>
					The CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients 
					the right to have emails stopped from being sent to them, and spells out tough penalties for violations.
				<br><br>
					We collect your email address in order to: • Send information, respond to inquiries, and/or other requests or questions
				<br><br>
					To be in accordance with CANSPAM, we agree to the following:
					• Not use false or misleading subjects or email addresses.

					• Include the physical address of our business or site headquarters.
					• Monitor third-party email marketing services for compliance, if one is used.
